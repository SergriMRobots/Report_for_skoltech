**My experience**

The team is small, consisting of young engineers, most of whom work at the RTK base, so there was only me and CEO Sergey Nikitin in the main office.

*My workspace*

The company treated me well, the director personally made sure in the first few days that I had no questions about how everything was arranged, who to turn to for help, where the cafeteria was, that I had a fully prepared work place and, in general, that I felt comfortable in a new environment in a new city. I was given a personal set of keys from the office and a pass to the research institute, so I moved freely between them and sometimes spent weekends at work because it was simply nice to go to work.

There were no strict rules or restrictions in the company, and I had a very flexible schedule. The only thing I had to do was write interim results of my work so that the team could understand what difficulties I had encountered and how they could be solved. My boss personally monitored my progress and helped me with advice.

Because Neurorobot is located in Moscow, I was invited to attend clinical trials of another of the company's products, the oncorobot, a robot for removing tumors using the photodynamic method.
